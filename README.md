# Netflix-Clone
Netflix Clone is an homage to the iconic streaming service, providing users with a glimpse of the familiar interface of Netflix. While it's a design and frontend-only project, it's a testament to my dedication to honing my skills in web design and frontend development.

# Technologies Used
HTML: Used for creating the form structure.
CSS: Used for styling the elements and making them responsive.
